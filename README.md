# DOMPigGame

> This is a clever javascript game to give an example of how DOM manipulation works.

### Game Rules

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his **round** score.
- If the player rolls a 1, all his **round** score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his **round** score gets added to his **global** score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- There is an input box where the players decide what the final score (winning score) is.
- The first player to reach the decided final score, wins the game.
